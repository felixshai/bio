# About me
## Why this file exists?
Since I can't speak English fluently (but pretty good at listening). I think it is better way to introduce myself in text form for now.

## Before learning programming
I was a graduate student major in mathematics and interest in the implement of Quantum computer. Since the eager of interpersonal relationship and the lack of money, I dropped out the degree. Now learning programming in Institute for Information Industry at Taiwan, expected finishing the course at 2017 Feb.

## My interest area in programming
OpenAPI is my main interest field. It includes

1. How to properly convert data to machine readable.
2. How to design a friendly API to make data accessible to people.

I think they are also the main infranstructure that Taiwan Governments needs. Right now, Taiwan has OpenData website but has lots of useless data like address and tel-number of an institute or even complete empty excel file.

I also interesting in self-driving cars which involves machining learning. But I think the industry environment in Taiwan isn't ready for it, and it requires more experience in programming. I think it is better way to put it in a long-term goal. 

And I like pixel art.
